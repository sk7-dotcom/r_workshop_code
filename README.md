# Air Quality Data Analysis Script

This R script is designed to clean and analyze air quality data. It
performs various operations such as calculating average solar radiation
for each month, determining correlations between Ozone and Solar
Radiation for each month, saving plots for each month, and saving
cleaned data. The script uses the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages for
data visualization and manipulation.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure you have R and the necessary packages installed (ggplot2,
    dplyr).
2.  Download or clone the script file `script.R`.
3.  Run the script using an R environment.

<!-- -->

    # Load the necessary libraries
    library(ggplot2)
    library(dplyr)

    # Run the script
    source("script.R")

## Functionality

The script provides the following functionalities:

-   **Data Cleaning:** Removes rows with missing values from the air
    quality data.
-   **Calculating Averages:** Calculates the average solar radiation for
    each month and prints the results to the console.
-   **Calculating Correlations:** Determines the correlation between
    Ozone and Solar Radiation for each month and prints the results to
    the console.
-   **Plot Generation:** Generates plots for each month, visualizing the
    relationship between Solar Radiation and Ozone.
-   **Data Saving:** Saves the cleaned data to a CSV file.
